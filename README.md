## React Fundamentals Used
- **Functional Components**: Each section of the portfolio is structured as a functional component (e.g., `Hero.js`, `About.js`, `Projects.js`).
- **Props**: Used to pass data dynamically to reusable components.
- **State Management**: `useState` is used for handling UI state (e.g., toggling navigation menu).
- **React Hooks**: `useEffect` is used for side effects like animations.
- **Event Handling**: Handlers for buttons, form submissions, and navigation interactions.
- **React Router**: Used to manage navigation smoothly across different sections of the site.

## CSS Details
The styling follows a modular approach with separate CSS files for each component. The key CSS techniques used include:
- **Flexbox & Grid**: Used to structure layouts and align elements responsively.
- **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming and color usage.
- **Animations & Transitions**: Smooth scrolling and hover effects using CSS `transition` and `keyframes`.
- **Media Queries**: Ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
